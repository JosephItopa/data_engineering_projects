Hi,

To run the file and know how it works:

1) Create a virtual environment

2) Install the libraries in requirements.txt

3) Run the command below on the terminal:

  python app.py run

4) To run on cloud we can use Google cloud functions with time trigger, which is every sunday midnight.

5) First we containerize the application, and then take the image to Google cloud function.
